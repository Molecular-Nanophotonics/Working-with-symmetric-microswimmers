A active particle in a squared environment. In one half it moves faster then in the other one (comparable to Nics experiment).

Particle in a box.ipynb - Create a single trajectory
Multiple Particle in a box.ipynb - Create multiple trajectories (here with different velocity differents between the two sides)
Compare multiple trajectories.ipynb - Compare the important parameters for different trajectories
