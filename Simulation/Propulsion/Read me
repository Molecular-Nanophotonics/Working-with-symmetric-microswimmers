Notebooks, simulating the propulsion mechanism of the symmetric particles belong here.

Single trajectory - is a notebook which creates a single trajectory of a symmetric swimmer which is propelled to the right. 
  All parameters like the frame rate dt, delay, velocity, offset... and so on can be changed.
  It analysis the motion.
  
Multiple trajectories - creates multiple trajectories, at the moment the offset is changed for every trajectory
  saves the important parameters as a txt-file
  
Compare multiple trajectories - loads the txt-file and compares the parameters
